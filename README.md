Module 4 Pandas assignment submission for Data Analytics Bootcamp - UoT SCS
# Overview
This analysis was conducted using two CSV files: **School Data** and **Student Data**.

- **School Data:** Contains details of 15 schools within a district, including school name, type, student population, and allocated budget.
- **Student Data:** Provides a comprehensive dataset of 39,170 students, listing their names, gender, grade, school, and scores in maths and reading.

Using Pandas to read both csv files and merge it into a complete dataset, the following analyses were performed and summarized in a DataFrame:

---

### 1. District-Level Performance

  - School type, total student population, total budget, and budget per student.
  - Average maths and reading scores.
  - Overall passing rates for maths and reading.

---

### 3. Top and Bottom Schools
- Identified the highest-performing and bottom-performing schools based on overall passing rates.

---

### 4. Grade-Level Performance
